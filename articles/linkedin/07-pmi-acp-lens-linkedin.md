# Agile Is Not About Speed: A PMI-ACP Perspective (LinkedIn)

Most organizations trying to "go agile" miss the point entirely.

They measure success by velocity. They celebrate shipping faster. They expect agility to make them quicker.

And then—same late deliveries, more chaos, burned-out teams.

Here's the disconnect: **Agile isn't about speed. It's about value delivery with intent, feedback, and continuous learning.**

As a PMI-ACP, I've learned that agile isn't a rebellion against project management. It's an evolution of it.

## Speed Isn't Success

I watched a team ship a 3-month payment feature in 6 weeks. Impressive velocity.

But customers barely used it. The assumptions were wrong. The requirements were misunderstood.

Then we discovered what actually mattered: reducing payment failures. Different feature entirely.

**Traditional Success Metric:** On-time, on-budget delivery
**Real Success Metric:** Customer outcomes that matter

Not the same thing.

## Value Over Velocity

Here's how a PMI-ACP reframes the question:

❌ "How fast can we ship?"
✅ "Are we shipping value customers actually use?"

❌ "What's our velocity?"
✅ "What's the business impact of what we shipped?"

❌ "Did we complete the sprint?"
✅ "Did we move the needle on customer problems?"

## Planning Still Matters

Biggest agile myth: "No planning."

Reality: Agile planning is more rigorous, not less.

Instead of a 12-month plan that becomes obsolete, use **three-horizon planning:**

**Horizon 1 (Next Sprint):**
High detail. Customer stories. Acceptance criteria.

**Horizon 2 (3 Months):**
Medium detail. Feature-level epics. Rough effort.

**Horizon 3 (6-12 Months):**
Low detail. Strategic vision. Value targets.

Each horizon evolves as you learn. Plans aren't fiction—they're living documents updated every sprint.

**Key: Measure progress against outcomes, not timeline.**

Did we hit the customer goal? Did we learn something that changes our direction? That's PMI-ACP discipline.

## Leadership as Service

The biggest shift in agile leadership:

From command-and-control → Enable self-organization

**Old Manager:** "I assign work. I control information. I decide direction."
**Servant Leader:** "I remove blockers. I share context. I facilitate decisions."

Three behaviors that matter:

**1. Remove Impediments Actively**
Not: "Let me know if you need anything."
Yes: "Why are you blocked? I'm going to unblock you today."

Track this. When I lead teams, I maintained an impediment log. "This week I unblocked: unclear API docs, database query performance, stakeholder decision delay."

**2. Foster Psychological Safety**
"Tell me if we're making a mistake" only works if you genuinely want to hear it.

Create space where:
- People admit mistakes without fear
- Disagreement is encouraged
- Bad news arrives early

**3. Bridge Strategy and Execution**
Often gap: Executives don't know why we're building this. Teams don't know why it matters.

You bridge that: "Here's the business outcome we're chasing. Here's why this feature moves the needle. This is what success looks like."

## Continuous Improvement: The Real Competitive Advantage

Retrospectives are often treated as checkbox ceremonies. "Let's complain for 90 minutes."

PMI-ACP lens: Retrospectives are where agility lives.

**Good Retrospective:**
- Specific focus: "Why did we slip this deadline?"
- Root cause: Not blame, but "What assumption was wrong?"
- Testable action: "We'll spike uncertain technical areas before estimating. Sarah owns this. We measure the impact next sprint."
- Follow-up: We actually execute the action.

**Improvement ROI I've tracked:**
- Time invested in improvements: 6 days/quarter
- Time saved: ~15 days/quarter (rework prevented, faster processes)
- ROI: 2.5:1

Show leadership this. Agility pays.

## Common Failures

**Failure 1: Treating Agile as Speed**
Agile makes you faster at delivery, but smarter about what you build. If you're moving faster toward the wrong goal, you're just crashing sooner.

**Failure 2: Overloading Teams**
If your team works 50-hour weeks, you're not agile. You're doing waterfall faster. Sustainable pace is a competitive advantage.

**Failure 3: Leadership Doesn't Change**
You can't have self-organizing teams in a command-and-control culture. Agility requires leaders to shift behaviors—share authority, listen more, enable decision-making.

**Failure 4: Forgetting the Discipline**
Agile without project management rigor is chaos. Good agile is disciplined—clear scope, measured outcomes, managed risks, sustainable pace.

## What PMI-ACP Brought Me

The certification forced me to hold two things:
- **Discipline:** Planning, measurement, risk management
- **Adaptability:** Responding to change, frequent feedback, iterative delivery

These aren't contradictions. They're complementary.

## The Real Value

Here's what happens when you do this right:

✅ Consistent delivery (velocity predictable ±10%)
✅ Better quality (fewer defects, faster customer feedback)
✅ Engaged teams (people stay, grow, do their best work)
✅ Real customer value (shipped features people actually use)
✅ Sustainable pace (no burnout culture)

Not because you're faster. Because you're smarter.

## What Now?

Ask yourself:
- Are we optimizing for speed or value?
- Do our leaders remove impediments or pile them on?
- Do we follow through on retrospective improvements?
- Are we measuring what matters (customer outcomes) or just activity?

That's PMI-ACP thinking. That's agile done right.

*Agile isn't a trend. It's how you manage complex work in uncertain conditions. Done well, it's not faster—it's smarter. And smart always wins.*
